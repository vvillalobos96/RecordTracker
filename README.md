# RecordTracker
This WebApp will track a users LP collection.
My father currently has a collection of over 1400 LPs. I'm creating this webapp to help him track them & allow us to better gauge what he has & what's missing.

This web app would include an interface for adding new LPs & editing existing records. It will also include an interface to search & filter through his collection. Ideally there would be functionality to allow for him to export the data, but that might come later down the road. This web app will allow for different users to log on with different access rights, so that my father can edit data, while the rest of us have view-only access. The scope of this project is to organize the site for my family. Eventually, user functionality will expand to allow other users to sign up & start tracking their collections. 

Tables will include:
-Users
-Passwords
-Roles
-Collection
-Artists
-Albums
-Formats
-Labels
-Songs

Actions will include:
-Add
-Update
-Delete
-View
